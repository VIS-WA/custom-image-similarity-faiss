This notebook is adapted from HuggingFace's [Image Similarity with ðŸ¤— Datasets and ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/image-similarity) blog post. The original notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_similarity.ipynb#scrollTo=fAYCqp0Ufx_V). This notebook is modified to work with custom datasets and intended for beginners to learn how to build an image similarity system with ðŸ¤—, custom datasets and FAISS.

Steps to build are included in the notebook.
